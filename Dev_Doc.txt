1. Project Overview

Goals

My portfolio site aims to:

This portfolio is designed to present my capabilities in both design and development through an engaging, 
interactive experience. By using modern web technologies—such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, 
and GSAP—and serves as a dynamic tool to showcase my artistic strengths and creative problem-solving in design. Beyond displaying my best work, 
it acts as a living record of my evolution as a developer throughout the program, aimed at capturing the attention of potential employers and clients.

Objectives

Present 4–6 completed projects with in-depth case studies
Integrate GSAP-powered animations for a smooth, immersive user experience
Develop a fully functional contact form with backend database connectivity
Ensure a responsive, mobile-first layout that performs flawlessly across devices
Maintain clean, well-documented code for scalability and readability
Optimize site performance

2. Technical Documentation
2.1 Tech Stack
Frontend Technologies:

HTML5: Utilized for semantic and accessible markup
CSS3 with SASS/SCSS: Employed for modular, maintainable styling
JavaScript (ES6+): Powers interactivity and dynamic content
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): Enables smooth, high-performance animations

Backend Technologies:

PHP 8.x: Handles server-side logic and backend functionality
MySQL: Manages structured data storage and retrieval

Development Tools:

Git & GitHub: Version control and collaborative code management
Visual Studio Code: Primary integrated development environment (IDE)
Browser Developer Tools: Used for real-time debugging and performance tuning
Responsive Design Testing Tools: Ensure seamless cross-device compatibility

Hosting environment:

[To be determined - likely shared hosting with PHP/MySQL support]

2.2 System Architecture
Static Components:

Home/Hero Section: Visually engaging landing area featuring animated introductions
About Page: Includes personal biography, skillset overview, and downloadable résumé
Navigation: Sticky/fixed navigation bar with smooth scrolling for intuitive user flow

Dynamic Components (Powered by PHP & MySQL)

Projects Gallery: 
Dynamically generated from a database
Admin interface for adding, editing, and deleting projects
Each project entry includes: title, description, tech stack, visuals, live demo link, and GitHub repository


Contact Form: 
Captures user input (Name, Email, Subject, Message, Timestamp)
Includes PHP-based validation and input sanitization
Optional feature: automated email notifications to the site administrator


Optional Blog Section:

4. ERD Diagram

Check the images folder, where i have my ERD diagram for my portfolio website.

5. Page Structure Decision
For this project, I’ve opted for a multi-page site structure to provide clear separation between key content areas such as About,
Projects, and Contact. This approach enhances user navigation and allows each section to be more focused and informative.
Dynamic content—like the project gallery and contact form—is powered by PHP and MySQL, ensuring efficient data management and backend functionality across the site.

Page Breakdown:
Home: Introduction animated image + Hero section + Featured projects preview 
About: Full biography with skill level display and timeline
Projects: Grid layout with filtering, each card links to detail view
Project Detail: Individual page for each project (PHP template)
Contact: Form and information page


6. GreenSock (GSAP) Enhancements
Planned Animations

Homepage:
Hero Text Animation: Slide-up for heading and subheading
Logo/Icon Animation: Spinning SVG logo on load
Scroll Indicator: Slide bar on the side

Navigation:
